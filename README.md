Venom: The Last Dance Review — Mostly Joyless Trilogy Ender Shuffles to Obsoletion.

Despite several attempts to start new franchises, the only successful property in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe has been Venom. Yet, with the self-proclaimed “last dance,” that cash cow is running out of milk. Although Venom: The Last Dance doesn’t stoop to the embarrassing lows of this year’s earlier Ssmu entry, Madame Web, it is a frustrating experience with just enough shining moments to make you realize how much more fun this should have been.

Venom: The Last Dance Review

Venom: The Last Dance picks up with Eddie Brock and Venom (Hardy) on the run after the events of Let There Be Carnage, as they discover that in addition to the cops, they’re also being hunted by an otherworldly force intent on destroying them both. If you think this sounds like an intriguing set-up for a superhero buddy road movie, you’re not wrong. Unfortunately, that’s not what the film becomes.


Venom: The Last Dance hopes to liven up the October box office this weekend with a domestic debut of $65 million and $100 million overseas, even though it’s looking like the threequel’s North American launch may be the lowest of Sony’s prized antihero franchise.

The first Venom opened to $80.2 million in 2018, then a record for October. It lost the crown a year later to Joker ($96.2 million). The second installment, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, debuted in October 2021 to $90 million, a boon for theater owners who were still recovering from the pandemic and a major win for Sony.

Venom: The Last Dance should have no trouble nabbing the biggest opening of October 2024 to date after Joker: Foile à Deux flamed out with a $37 million debut following the sequel’s unprecedented D CinemaScore.

In the case of Venom, it’s not uncommon for threequels to fall off. Sony is confident, however,...

It's fair to say that we're in the dying days of the superhero movie boom. No, I don't mean the superhero movie is going away — it's not. Hell, Marvel Studios' "Deadpool & Wolverine" recently became a box office success and audiences seemed to like it, too (although I wasn't a fan). But these days, "Deadpool & Wolverine" feels more like the exception rather than the rule.

There was a time there when it seemed like any superhero movie was too big to fail, but after being inundated with a constant barrage of comic book characters brought to digital life, audiences are starting to grow warry. It certainly doesn't help that the vast majority of these movies aren't very good, either. As a critic, I'm not really concerned with box office. I have no financial stake in the movie, so whatever it earns opening weekend doesn't really interest me. No, what I'm interested in is quality.
